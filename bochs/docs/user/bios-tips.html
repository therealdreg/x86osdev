>A bootable CD-ROM has a special layout that is detected by the
BIOS boot loader code, and executed if it conforms the specifications.
This layout is called "El Torito Bootable CD-ROM Format Specification"
and has been published by Phoenix and IBM. A copy of this spec is on

        </P

>El Torito specifies 3 ways to have a bootable CD:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>floppy emulation boot: A standard floppy image is burnt on the CD.
In this case the BIOS has to redirect all first floppy accesses to this
image and the real floppy drive becomes the second one.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>a "no emulation" boot: In this case the BIOS is instructed to load an
arbitrary number of sectors straight into memory, and execute it.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>hard disk emulation: A hard disk image is burnt on the CD. The
BIOS has to redirect all hard disk accesses to that image. The real hard disks
are still available, with BIOS numbers 81h and up.</P
></LI
></UL
>

In Bochs 2.0, hard disk emulation is not implemented in the BIOS.
There are also subtilities about multiple boot-images CD-ROMs, that are
not handled by Bochs.
        </P
><P
>However, our BIOS may be more strict than real PC BIOSes, I don't know.
But I would definitely be interested to know of any CD that can boot
on real hardware, but does not in Bochs.
        </P
><P
>When failing to boot from CD-ROM, the BIOS outputs
the reason of the failure as
an error code, in the log file, and on the screen.

0x02 no atapi cdrom found</PRE

For the first two errors, an ata-*: type=cdrom is probably missing
from the configuration file. This is what you get if no cdrom has
been defined in Bochs conf file.</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>0x03 can not read cd - BRVD</PRE
>

For this error, the cdrom support has not been compiled in Bochs,
or Bochs could not open the file or device. This is what you get if
Bochs is not able to read the cd.</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>0x04 cd is not eltorito (BRVD)
0x05 cd is not eltorito (ISO TAG)
0x06 cd is not eltorito (ELTORITO TAG)</PRE
>

For these errors, the data has been read from the cd, but
the cd does not conform to the El Torito specification. This
is what you get if the cd is not bootable.</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>0x08 boot catalog : bad header
0x09 boot catalog : bad platform
0x0A boot catalog : bad signature
0x0B boot catalog : bootable flag not set</PRE

now the cd is eltorito, but the boot catalog is corrupted, or
the cd was made to boot on a ppc system. This should not happen
for a x86 bootable cd.</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>0x07 can not read cd - boot catalog
0x0C can not read cd - boot image</PRE

here, specific part of the cd could not be read. This should
definitely not happen.</P

><P
>Since the beginning of the PC era, disks have grown in size by a factor of 10000. Due to
differences between the ATA specification and BIOSes implementations, when disks reached
critical sizes, it
became necessary to translate the CHS geometry (cylinders, heads, sectors per track)
between the BIOS (int 13h) and the ATA interface. Please refer to the

    head count would become 256, and MS-DOS thought this was 0)

    a lower spt value will lead to a lower maximum disk size.

>    a revised bitshift algorithm (called Revised Extended-CHS)
    is used to translate the CHS between
    the int13h interface
    and the ATA interface. First the number of physical heads is forced to
    15, and the number of cylinders is adjusted accordingly.
    Then, as in the simple extended CHS algorithm, the translation
    is achieved by
    multiplying/dividing the cylinder/head count by a power of 2
    (2, 4, 8 or 16).
    The head count being forced to 15, it can safely be multiplied by 16
    without crashing dos.
    Note that the number of sectors per track is not changed, so
    a lower spt value will lead to a lower maximum disk size.

>    a LBA-assisted algorithm
    is used to translate the CHS between
    the int13h interface
    and the ATA interface. The translation is achieved by
    first computing the physical size of the disk (LBA=C*H*S).
    Then the sectors per track is forced to 63, and the head count
    to 255. Then the cylinder count is computed (C=LBA/(63*255))
    Note that the number of sectors per track is forced to 63
    in the logical geometry, regardless of the actual geometry
    reported by the disk.
    Also note that the LBA-assisted algorithm has nothing to do with
    LBA access at the ATA interface.
