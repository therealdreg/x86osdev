>The graphical front-end for the Bochs command line debugger
is available for Windows and GTK2/GTK3 hosts.</P
><P
>To use the gui debugger, you must configure Bochs with the
default debugger switch and the <CODE
CLASS="OPTION"
>--enable-debugger-gui</CODE
> flag.
For example:
<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>  ./configure --enable-debugger --enable-debugger-gui</PRE
></P
><P
>At runtime you need to add the value <CODE
CLASS="OPTION"
>gui_debug</CODE
> to the
<A
HREF="bochsrc.html#BOCHSOPT-DISPLAYLIBRARY"
>display_library</A
> options parameter
in order to use the gui instead of the command line debugger. This example shows
how to use it with the 'x' gui:
<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>display_library: x, options="gui_debug"</PRE

><P
>Typically, all the various registers are grouped by color. If you don't like the
colors, they can be turned off, or modified at compile time. There are options
to show or hide most register "groups", so that you can focus more strictly on
the registers you are interested in (probably just the GP registers).</P
><P
>Yes, the XMM display shows hex in the "decimal" column -- there is more
room there. Deal with it.</P
><P
>Doubleclicking a register attempts to change its value. Bochs may not
allow you to change most registers. In future versions, more registers may
be modifiable.</P

>8.2.3. The disassembly window</A
></H2
><P
>Disassembly output that is autoloaded, or generated from the menu, ends up
here. If the frontend cannot detect the "current instruction" in the list,
when it reaches the next instruction -- then it will autoload a new list.
Having a big list will reduce the number of autoloads, and allows you to see
more. The list can contain up to 2048 lines. However, if you load more than
1000 lines, you are more likely to see performance problems.</P
><P
>There are two kinds of emulated memory in bochs: Linear and Physical.
Emulated Linear memory is mapped onto Physical memory by x86 virtual memory
methods (paging and segmentation). If paging and segmenataion are "off", or
"identity mapped", then both "types" of memory mean the same thing. But they
still work a little differently. With the Internal Debugger, you can set
breakpoints to either kind of memory, separately. Normally, you would use
the "b" command to set breakpoints in physical mem, and "lb" to set breakpoints
in linear mem. This frontend ONLY displays linear breakpoints. It does not
bother trying to figure out the linear-&#62;phsical reverse mapping to show
physical breakpoints. (There are also "virtual" breakpoints that are also
not shown.) All the types of breakpoints still WORK, it is just that you
will not see them marked on the screen.</P
><P
>It will be obvious to you that the current instruction is marked in green,
unless it is on a breakpoint, when it turns blue. Breakpoints are red, of
course.</P
><P
>You must click a line in the window, before you can use frontend commands
to set or clear a linear breakpoint on it. You can doubleclick (which saves
steps) to set or clear a linear breakpoint.</P

>8.2.4. The MemDump window</A
></H2
><P
>As of this version, the MemDump window isn't much more than a display of the
contents of memory. In later versions, hopefully it will be expanded into a
fairly fully-featured hexeditor. You can dump either phyical mem, or linear
mem. There are breakpoint-like things (that work with physical memory only,
currently), called "watchpoints". A physical memory address can cause a break
in the simulation if it is read, or written.</P
><P
>The frontend again does NOT try to calculate out the linear -&#62; physical mapping
in any attempt to display the physical watchpoints while viewing linear mem.</P
><P
>You must click a hex byte (on a physical mem dump that shows bytes), in order to
set or clear a read and/or write watchpoint on that byte. Read watchpoints are
green (on black), write watchpoints are red, watchpoints that are both write
and read are blue. There is a hardcoded limit in bochs of 16 of each type of
watchpoint.</P

function. The Find function is pretty limited in scope, currently. It can
only find bytes (or strings of bytes) within each 16byte "line"</P

>The Output window shows anything that the Bochs Internal Debugger tries to send
to you. The window is scrollable, but only keeps a limited history of output (10K).
The ID is always spamming you with "Next at t=" and disassembly lines, that would
tend to fill up the Output window with garbage -- so there are options to ignore
either of these types of output.</P

Debugger -- bypassing the frontend. Results will appear in the Output Window.
The Input window has a history feature for commands, using the Up and Down arrows --
it remembers 64 commands, 80 bytes each. No matter where you click on the frontend,
you can always type directly into the Input box without clicking on it.</P
><P
>When the Input window is invisible, you should still be able to type into it --
after taking into account the bug listed at the bottom of this file.</P

resize the lists. The cursor will change, but there will be no animation.</P
><P
>If you grab the middle of one of the lists, and drag it on top of one of the
other lists, you can reorder the positions of the lists on the screen. The
cursor will change, but there will be no animation. You can set an alternate
"docking order" at compile time, also, if you have a permanent preference.

select a different display, it may take several seconds to delete the big display
before it can switch.</P

>Uppercase text tends to seem a little annoying, but it really is a lot easier to
read, especially on a proportional font. If you change to a fixed font, then you
may want to switch the display to lowercase.</P

restored at the next run.</P
