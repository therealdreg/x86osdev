>Multiple ATA channels</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates up to 4 ATA channels. Up to 8 ATA/ATAPI emulated devices can be attached,

    So you can have eight hard disks or seven hard disks and a CD-ROM or four hard
    disks and four CD-ROMs, or one hard disk and seven CD-ROMs, etc...
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Hard disk</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates ATA-6/IDE hard drives via image files.  Physical
    hard disk access is supported on some architecture, but NOT recommended, primarily for safety reasons.
    With LBA48 support, hard disks up to 255TB are supported, on any platform that support large files access.
    It is also possible to use a local directory as VFAT drive.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>CD-ROM</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates ATAPI-4/IDE CD-ROM.  The CD-ROMs can read from an ISO disk image
    on any platform. On Windows (NT/2000/XP/Vista), Linux, SunOS, FreeBSD,
    NetBSD, OpenBSD, Amiga/MorphOS and MacOSX, Bochs can read from the
    physical CD-ROM drive. The Bochs BIOS supports booting from the first CD-ROM drive.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Keyboard</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates a PS/2 keyboard with North American key mappings. Optional
    keyboard layout remapping files are provided to support localized keyboard
    in X11 (12 layouts, e.g. French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish, U.K.)
    and SDL/SDL2 (German).
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Mouse</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates a serial, PS/2, bus or USB mouse with 3 buttons + optional mouse
    wheel support. There is also a USB tablet emulation available.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Sound card</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates a Sound Blaster 16 card (ISA, no plug&amp;play) or an
    ES1370 PCI card. The SB16 emulation provides wave input / output, the OPL3
    chip, the external MIDI port and volume control for wave and FM. The ES1370
    provides wave input / output, the MIDI UART port and volume control for
    wave output. On Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS 9, MacOSX and all platforms
    supported by SDL, the output can be sent to the host computer's sound
    system. For the SB16, see the <A
HREF="../development/sb16-emulation-basics.html"

>developer documentation</A
>
    for details.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Network card</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates an NE2000 compatible network card (ISA / PCI) or an Intel(R)
    82540EM Gigabit Ethernet adapter (PCI). On Windows NT/2000, Linux, FreeBSD,
    and NetBSD, Bochs will forward packets to and from the
    operating system so that the guest OS can talk on the physical network.
    Unfortunately, on some platforms the guest OS can talk to any machine on
    the network BUT NOT the host machine.  On Windows and on systems that
    allow the TAP or TUN/TAP interface, there is no such limitation.  Often
    the host machine may be configured so the guest OS has access to the
    internet. On MacOSX, you may download the TUN driver from:

><TR
><TD
>Parallel Port</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Parallel port emulation was added by Volker Ruppert for Bochs 1.3.
    Data that is sent to the parallel port by the guest OS can be saved into a
    file or sent directly into the parallel port device (Unix only).
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Serial Port</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>The serial port (16550A UART emulation) is usable, on GNU/Linux,
    NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and MacOSX as host and guest. On other OSes the
    emulation is present, but the connection to hard- or software of the host is
    not implemented yet. Up to 4 ports are available.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Gameport</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates a standard PC gameport. The connection to a real joystick is
    currently supported on Linux and win32 only.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>PCI</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Emulates most of the i430FX, i440FX or i440BX PCI chipset.
    The Host-to-PCI bridge, the PCI-to-ISA bridge and the PCI IDE controller
    (PIIX3/PIIX4) are available. For PCI cards there are 5 PCI slots supported.
    ACPI and HPET features are also available. The i440BX chipset has basic
    support for AGP.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>USB</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Four types of host controllers (UHCI, OHCI, EHCI and xHCI) and the
    devices 'mouse', 'tablet', 'keypad', 'keyboard', 'disk', 'cdrom', 'floppy',
    'hub' and 'printer' are available. Plugging in and removing devices at runtime
    is possible. Access to real hardware is not implemented yet.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Plugins</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Compiling devices, gui and drivers for network, sound and disk image
    formats as plugins is supported on Linux, MacOS X, Solaris, Cygwin, MinGW/MSYS,
    MSVC nmake and the VS2019 IDE (workspace provided).
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>PIC</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Master and slave programmable interrupt controller.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>CMOS functions</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Real time clock (RTC) and CMOS RAM are available</TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Dynamic Translation/Virtualization</TD
><TD
>No</TD
><TD
>Because Bochs is designed to be portable, it does not attempt
    to do any dynamic code translation or virtualization. See
    <A
HREF="introduction.html#WHATISBOCHS"
>Section 1.1</A
> for details.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Simulate a Multiprocessor</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Bochs can be configured to simulate up to 254 processor threads.  This
    feature is still experimental, but it can boot several Linux or Windows guests
    with SMP support.  Please note that this does NOT mean that Bochs can run
    faster on a physical SMP machine.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Take advantage of your SMP box</TD
><TD
>Minimal</TD
><TD
>At present, Bochs only uses threads in some guis, in the lowlevel
    sound output code and in the Voodoo graphics adapter code. The simulation
    core itself uses only one thread, so it will not run any faster on
    multiprocessor hardware.
    </TD
></TR
><TR
><TD
>Copy and Paste</TD
><TD
>Yes</TD
><TD
>Depending on the host platform, the text-mode screen text can be
    exported to the clipboard. Text in the clipboard can also be pasted, through
    Bochs, to the guest OS, as simulated keystrokes.
