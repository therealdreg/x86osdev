TODO (know issues in CPU model):
-------------------------------

[!] The following 3DNow! instructions still not implemented:
	PF2IW_PqQq
	PFNACC_PqQq
	PFPNACC_PqQq
	PFCMPGE_PqQq
	PFCMPGT_PqQq
	PFCMPEQ_PqQq
	PFMIN_PqQq
	PFMAX_PqQq
	PFRCP_PqQq
	PFRSQRT_PqQq
	PFSUB_PqQq
	PFSUBR_PqQq
	PFADD_PqQq
	PFACC_PqQq,
	PFMUL_PqQq
	PFRCPIT1_PqQq
	PFRSQIT1_PqQq
	PFRCPIT2_PqQq

[!] CPUID does not report 3DNow! instruction set

[!] Some of APIC functionality still not implemented, for example

    - LVT pins handling
    - Filter interrupts according processor priority (PPR)

[!] REP NOP is PAUSE (on P4/XEON)

    When running in SMP mode, this means that we are in a spin loop.
    This processor should yield to the other one, as we are anyhow waiting
    for a lock, and any other processor is responsible for this.

[!] 32-bit linear address wrap when executing in legacy mode might be
    not implemented correctly for system memory accesses (like descriptor
    tables and etc)

[!] AMD and Intel x86_64 implementations are different.
    Currently Bochs emulation is according to Intel version.
    Do we need to support both ?

[!] VMX:

   - Dual-monitor treatment of SMIs and SMM not implemented yet
   - Posted Interrupts Processing is not implemented yet
   - MTF is not implemented yet

[!] SVM:

   - Decoding assists, pause filter, VMCB clean are not implemented yet
   - Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller (AVIC) not implemented yet
   - More?

[!] AMD misaligned SSE mode should convert #GP on misaligned SSE access to #AC
    exception when #AC is enabled

[!] TODO: Convert CPUDB to plugins and search for them in runtime

[!] TODO: Find a way to implement HLE and RTM extensions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[!] No plans for MPX, Intel Processor Trace, LWP.
    Their emulation would greatly affect emulation performance.
    Could be implemented through instrumentation if ***really*** needed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[!]: Some system operations have to be done atomically.
     This is the list for future reference:
     - A/D bit update in page table
     - A bit update in segment descriptor
     - BUSY bit in TSS
     - Busy bit in shadow stack
     - RSTORSSP
